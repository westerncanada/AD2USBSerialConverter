Convert an Alarmdecoder AD2USB to use an Ethernet to serial converter

### Items needed

- Alarm Decoder [AD2USB](https://www.alarmdecoder.com/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/29)
- [FS100P](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32963270624.html) Ethernet to Serial converter
- [Mini360](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32411154908.html) DC-DC Buck converter to power the FS100P
- Capton or generic equivalent tape for insulating the buck converter

### Wiring

On the AD2USB there are two surface mount pads for an interface connector, you can purchase these (I couldn't due to covid shortages) or solder directly to the pins that provide RX/TX on the board.  These are on the connector labeled "CON3" and are the pads on the uppermost right side when the screw post terminals are pointing down.

Sean from Alarmdeocder supplied me with these diagrams of the connector:
